    <h2>Why read like this?</h2>
    <p>
      When reading a form of media like a book or article in this age of hyper - stimulation, and 'dopamine hacking', it can feel hard if not impossible to keep your eyes on the words, and not stray off thinking about something else or worse, picking up the phone. Speedreeder.com hopes to offer a middle ground, one in which you can enjoy the experience of a long-form book or article, while ensuring that you can stay focused on the words being presented to you. On top of that, this form of reading can help people read up to 3x faster, giving them the same experience as a book, while having it infringe less upon your day.

    <h2>Can I retain what I read?</h2>
    <p>
        Of course you can! That is, with the proper usage of the tool. With a tool like SpeedReeder, you're given the power to immediately crank up the wpm to a thousand, and be done with your boring reading assignment in 10 minutes. If that's what you want out of the site, you do you! However, for those seeking to actually absorb the information in an effecient way, something this tool promises to do, I would encourage slowly stepping up the speed of the reader, utilising the 'Back 10 words', to re-read a sentence, and finally pausing and reading the preview text if necessary. Done properly, I hope you find this tool as useful as I have!

    <h2>I hate ads.</h2>
    <p>Me too. Unfortunately as a solo-programmer, I rely on ads as my sole revenue stream from this wesbite. Not to worry, however - In the works is a premium system, in which a user sick of ads like you, can pay a few bucks to never see them again. That way you can focus on speed reading, and I can still live off the site.</p>

    <h1>The 'SpeedReeder' Method</h1>

  <h1>About the SpeedReeder method:</h1>
     
  <section class="about-intro">
    <h2>RSVP</h2>
    <p>RSVP, or Rapid serial visual presentation is a method of reading mostly known for its scientific purpose of measuring how fast people can read words. It does this by rapidly flashing words in one location in front of the user. More recently, RSVP has been displayed in the media, most of the time as an online 'challenge' to see in what percentile of speed readers you sit in.
       At Speedreeder.com, we want to bring this method of reading mainstream, as we beleive it can improve the ability for readers to digest information, and decrease distractions while reading, all while maintaining the levels of comprehension on the text. (see elaboration below) Speedreeder.com is a tool that everyone can use, from college students on a crunch, or employees trying to increase effeciency.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="about-intro">
    <h2>The Comprehension Issue</h2>
    <p>One of the main critisms of the RSVP method, is that the nature of only being shown one word at a time, and not being able to go back words on command decreases reader's comprehension levels, however we've tackled this issue head-on, and beleive that through the introduction of features such the 'preview text', and the 'back 10 words' button mitigate this possibility. However, the best way to maintain
        comperehension while utilising SpeedReeder, is to pace yourself, truly absorb what you're being shown, and become familiar with the tools we've provided.

    <h2>The Future of Speedreeder</h2>
    <p>The current version of Speedreeder.com is still the beta version. In the future I'd like to integrate a premium version, costing a few bucks a month so you guys don't have to get distracted by ads as my primary form of revenue. I'd also like to add a functionality in which you can set a background for the reading page - a kind of screensaver to go behind the text, to make for a more asthetic, relaxing experience. Regardless, I've got plenty of ideas for the future of this tool, so stay tuned, and submit your ideas in the contact/feedback page!</p>
